# IntelliJ IDEA Project Configuration for JavaFX LMS

This file describes how to set up the JavaFX Learning Management System (LMS) project in IntelliJ IDEA for optimal development experience.

---

## 1. Open the Project
- Open IntelliJ IDEA.
- Select **File > Open...** and choose the project root directory (`HelloFx`).

## 2. Configure Project SDK
- Go to **File > Project Structure > Project**.
- Set the **Project SDK** to Java 11 or higher.
- If not available, click **Add SDK** and select your JDK installation.

## 3. Add JavaFX Libraries
- Go to **File > Project Structure > Libraries**.
- Click the **+** button and select **Java**.
- Navigate to the `lib/` directory in your project and select all JavaFX JARs and the SQLite JDBC JAR.
- Click **OK** to add them.

## 4. Configure VM Options for JavaFX
- Go to **Run > Edit Configurations...**
- Select your main run configuration (or create one for `hellofx.Main`).
- In **VM options**, add:
  ```
  --module-path lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
  ```

## 5. Mark Source and Resource Folders
- In the Project view, right-click `src/` and select **Mark Directory as > Sources Root**.
- If you have a `resources/` folder, mark it as **Resources Root**.

## 6. Database File
- Ensure `lms.db` is present in the project root. The application expects the database file at this location.

## 7. Build and Run
- Build the project using **Build > Build Project**.
- Run the application using the configured run configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If you see JavaFX runtime errors, double-check the VM options and library setup.
- For database issues, ensure the SQLite JDBC JAR is included and `lms.db` is accessible.

---

## Version Control
- The `.idea/` folder and `*.iml` files are project-specific and can be added to `.gitignore` if you want a clean repository.
